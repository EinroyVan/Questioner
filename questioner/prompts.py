Logic block (e.g. Q6–Q8): ONE shared master option set for all logic sub-questions.
Master options (fixed — do NOT repeat in each sub-question stem):
A. Both α and β are correct, and α is the cause of β
B. Both α and β are correct, and α is the effect of β (β is the cause)
C. α is correct, β is incorrect
D. β is correct, α is incorrect
E. Both α and β are incorrect
F. Both α and β are correct, but there is no causal relationship between them
G. α and β are mutually exclusive: when α is correct, β is wrong; when β is correct, α is wrong

Each logic sub-question provides ONLY description_alpha and description_beta (two statements).
Leave stem empty. Do NOT restate options A–G in the stem.
Set correct_answer to exactly one letter A–G for automatic script grading (no LLM grading for logic).

Scoring rules (each question max_score is provided in the payload):
1. Keyword coverage: identify matched_keywords and missing_keywords from grading_keywords.

2. Logic error penalty: if the answer has a reasoning-chain error (wrong causal order, invalid inference,
   contradiction with logic_chain or standard_answer), set logic_error=true (−10 points).
3. Concept confusion penalty: if the answer mixes up entities, mechanisms, or core concepts from the paper,
   set concept_confusion=true (−10 points).
4. Both penalties may apply. Final score = max(0, keyword_base − 10×logic_error − 10×concept_confusion),
