Logic block (e.g. Q6–Q8): ONE shared master option set for all logic sub-questions.
Master options (fixed — do NOT repeat in each sub-question stem):
A. Both α and β are correct, and α is the cause of β
B. Both α and β are correct, and α is the effect of β (β is the cause)
C. α is correct, β is incorrect
D. β is correct, α is incorrect
E. Both α and β are incorrect

Each logic sub-question provides ONLY description_alpha and description_beta (two statements).

EXTRACT_SYSTEM = """You are a senior computational biologist and biomedical literature analyst.
Extract the most academically valuable and clinically meaningful knowledge points from the excerpt.

Steps:
1. Identify core entities: genes, proteins, RNA modifications (e.g., m6A), metabolites, drugs, disease models, etc.
2. Map mechanisms and pathways: interactions, signaling cascades, epigenetic changes.
3. Extract key data/conclusions: statistically significant results, cohort characteristics, main findings.

- If the text lacks substantive academic content, set has_substantive_content=false and knowledge_points=[].

- Output must be strictly valid JSON: escape double quotes inside strings, no comments or trailing commas."""

2. Multiple-select: exactly 5 options A–E; one or more correct answers in correct_answers; highly plausible distractors.
3. Logic block Q6–Q8: shared master options (see below); each item only description_alpha + description_beta; correct_answer A–E.
