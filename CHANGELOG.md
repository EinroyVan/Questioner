# Changelog

All notable changes to BioQuestion are documented in this file.

## [1.2.2] — 2026-06-22

### Logic questions UI

- Logic block (Q6–Q8) shows **one master section** explaining shared A–E options once.
- Each sub-question displays only **α** and **β** descriptions; user picks **A–E** without repeated option text.

### Scoring efficiency

- Single-choice, multi-select, and logic questions are **script-graded only** (no LLM tokens).
- LLM is invoked **only for short-answer** questions; skipped entirely when a quiz has none.
- Quiz prompts require accurate `correct_answer` / `correct_answers` at generation time.

### Profile

- Nickname limit updated to **at most 12 full-width characters** (≤12).

## [1.2.1] — 2026-06-22

### Quiz modes & question types

- Renamed **EZ mode** to **Easy mode**; single-choice questions are now strictly **4 options, pick 1** (A–D).
- Reworked **Normal mode** structure and scoring (total **100 points**):
  - Multi-select: 5 questions × **10 pts** (2 pts per option, A–E)
  - Logic: 3 questions × **6 pts** (wrong answer = 0 pts)
  - Short answer: 2 questions × **16 pts**
- Added **Custom mode**: configure counts of single-choice, multi-select, logic, and short-answer questions.
- Added **logic questions** with fixed A–E relationship template (α/β cause–effect and correctness).

### Scoring

- Multi-select: if the correct set has **only one option**, **1 miss + 1 wrong selection** scores **0**.
- Updated penalty captions and grading UI to reflect 2-pt-per-option rules.

### Localization

- Knowledge extraction, quiz generation, and grading prompts now follow the **sidebar UI language**.
- Logic option labels are translatable via UI strings.

### Personal statistics

- Scored submissions (Normal / Custom) require a **nickname** before saving.
- Nickname must be **fewer than 12 full-width characters**; stored locally in `output/stats/profile.json`.
- Score history supports Normal and Custom modes.

### Other

- Learning reports support logic and single-choice question types.
- i18n cache bumped to v3 for new UI strings.
